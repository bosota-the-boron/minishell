🖥️ Mini Shell

A simple mini-shell in C 🧑‍💻 that mimics basic terminal functionalities, limited to the use of the stdio.h library. This project allows you to run commands like ls and exit while simulating an interactive shell behavior 🚀.
⚙️ Features

    💬 Interactive Command Prompt: Users can enter commands just like in a regular terminal.
    🗂️ Simulates ls command: Displays a list of fictional files when the user types ls.
    ❌ exit command: Exits the shell when the user types exit.
    🔒 Limited to stdio.h: No external libraries are used (no string.h, dirent.h, or others).

📂 Available Commands

    ls : Lists fictional files in the directory 🗂️
    exit : Exits the shell 🚪
    help : not for noob

🛠️ Compilation

    Clone the repository:
      git clone https://github.com/username/mini-shell.git
  Compile the program:
    gcc -o mini-shell main.c
  Run the mini-shell:
    ./mini-shell

🎯 Goal

The aim of this project is to understand the basics of creating a simple shell by manipulating strings and user inputs with basic tools in C 🔧. It's a great project for beginners looking to improve their understanding of C programming and terminal interactions.
